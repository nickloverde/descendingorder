// Description:
// Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

// Examples:
// Input: 42145 Output: 54421

// Input: 145263 Output: 654321

// Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

// I know that I'll need to convert the number to an array first
// But to create an array I need to convert the number to a string with toString
// Then, I'll use .split to divide each character and put it in an array
// Then, I'll use the .sort method which will put it in alphabetically or with numbers ascending order
// Then, I'll reverse the ascending order
// After that I'll join it again 
// I can then use Number to put it back in a number or wrap everything in a parseInt and return that
